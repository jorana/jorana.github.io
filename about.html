        <p><h4>For the past 23 years, I have spent working accross different fields of the manufacturing industry;
            Semiconductor front and back-end to Medical Laboratory Equipment. Amassing amountable knowledge and 
            skillsets that one would need. 
        </h4></p>
        <p><h4>Now I need to upgrade my academic knowledge, thus, I am taking up Computer Engineering Technology
            at NAIT. Since we are now entering the new era of technology that is called AI.
        </h4></p>
        <p><h4>You could always see me busy doing assignments during school days and everytime I get a freetime, you
            will see me sanding, cutting, gluing, painting and detailing plastics to create a work of art.
